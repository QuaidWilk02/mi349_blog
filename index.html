        <p>I have been wrestling since I was eight years old. I bounced school to school to try to find the right team for me. I have wrestled for Flushing, Swartz Creek, and a wrestling club called AAGA. Everytime I thought I found the right team something would happen. Usually that would be the coach leaving. This was until I met my coach named Wass. He ran a club called Michigan Pitbulls and needed another wrestler for a national tournament. I decided to go to the tournament and decided to stay with his club. He helped me figure out the best way for me to wrestle and turned me into a top tier wrestler. I wrestled from elementary to high school. However, I had to stop after my shoulder got injured. During a match I was picked up and slammed directly on my shoulder. This caused it to dislocate and form a cyst. I tried to wrestle for three years after that, until I could not take it any more and had surgery. I have not joined a tournament since then. I still miss it a little, so I visit my old wrestling club though and I help coach the younger kids to help out Wass.

          <p>I have been cosplaying with my family for five to six years at this point. My brothers have been cosplaying before that for a couple years, but I was finally able to join them. We cosplayed as our favorite pro heroes from the anime My Hero Academia. We did not even make it out of the parking lot before people took pictures of us. I never felt so liked before. Ever since then we have tried to cosplay at least once a year. Our dad actually built most of our cosplays with wood, foam, chicken wire, and fabric. We will show him a character from a show we like and tell him that he does not have to make it perfect. However, he still tries to make the outfit as perfect as possible, even if it takes a long time. Somehow he always makes them look incredible. A few years ago my sister actually started cosplaying with us. She cosplayed as one of her favorite characters from a game called Danganronpa. She was nervous at first, but so many people loved her cosplay that she wanted to do it again. She has been cosplaying with us ever since. These are some of the cosplays I have worn throughout the years.</p>
