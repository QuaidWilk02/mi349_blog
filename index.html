        <p>I have been wrestling since I was eight years old. I bounced school to school to try to find the right team for me. I have wrestled for Flushing, Swartz Creek, and a wrestling club called AAGA. Everytime I thought I found the right team something would happen. Usually that would be the coach leaving. This was until I met my coach named Wass. He ran a club called Michigan Pitbulls and needed another wrestler for a national tournament. I decided to go to the tournament and decided to stay with his club. He helped me figure out the best way for me to wrestle and turned me into a top tier wrestler. I wrestled from elementary to high school. However, I had to stop after my shoulder got injured. During a match I was picked up and slammed directly on my shoulder. This caused it to dislocate and form a cyst. I tried to wrestle for three years after that, until I could not take it any more and had surgery. I have not joined a tournament since then. I still miss it a little, so I visit my old wrestling club though and I help coach the younger kids to help out Wass.
